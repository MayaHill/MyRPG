# MyRPG-4-April-9-May

The goal of this project was to create an RPG which would incorporate the following points:
• Having a pleasant user interface.
• Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, ...)
• Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal (quest system).
• Create a game with a beginning and an end.

Install the library to launch the program with: "sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev libcsfml-doc"

To launch the game, use "./my_rpg"

(Example: "./my_rpg")
