The goal of this project was to create an RPG which would incorporate the following points:

• Having a pleasant user interface.

• Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, ...).

• Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal (quest system).

• Create a game with a beginning and an end.
